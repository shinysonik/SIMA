## Problem statement
Robot management is one of the main tasks of Eurobot. And the success of the autonomous robots competition depends very much on the implementation of the control.
Goal is to develop and implement an advanced control system using MPC and LQR to robotic platforms of omni-wheeled and conventional wheels robots.
